<p>prtunnel is a program that can tunnel TCP/IP connections in a variety of ways, including through HTTP and SOCKS5 proxy servers. Some if its possible uses include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tunneling TCP connections from client programs to a remote server through an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy (useful if you're behind such a proxy and want to use a program that doesn't have native proxy support)</li>

        <li>Tunneling TCP connections from SOCKS-capable client programs through an HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy</li>
        <li>Tunneling TCP connections from an IPv4 client program to an IPv6 server and vice-versa</li>
        <li>Forwarding TCP connections</li>
        <li>Running as a simple SOCKS proxy server</li>
    </ul>

    <p>prtunnel is open source software available under a BSD-style license. It has been developed and used under Linux and BSD-based operating systems.</p>
