Below is a list of articles and papers that I've written.

- [Introduction to the Git Version Control System](introduction-to-git-version-control-system)

  This article provides an introduction to the Git version control system, guiding you through the process of creating a new Git repository and making commits.

- [Exploring Spatial Data Management in 3D Graphics and Game Engines](../files/Exploring Spatial Data Management in 3D Graphics and Game Engines.pdf)

  This paper was written in 2016 as part of my Master of Software Engineering degree at [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/). It describes several data structures for managing spatial data in real-time 3D graphics applications, and presents results from a simulation program that was developed to aid in measuring and comparing the performance of such data structures. The simulation program is a macOS application written in Swift that uses OpenGL for graphics rendering, and it is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/joshb/SpatialDataStructures).

- [Security in Modern Web Applications](../files/Security in Modern Web Applications.pdf)

  This paper was written in 2013 as part of my Master of Software Engineering degree at [Auburn University](https://www.auburn.edu/). It describes various security-related best practices employed by web applications. Topics covered include operating system and web server security, database security, techniques for storing and verifying passwords, minimizing the risk of social engineering attacks, and preventing technical attacks such as those involving cross-site scripting and SQL injection.

- [Getting Started with the OpenGL Shading Language](getting_started_with_glsl/)

  This article provides an introduction to the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). It contains sample C and GLSL code, and is accompanied by a demo program with full source code.

- [Triangle Rasterization](triangle_rasterization/)

  This article presents an algorithm for drawing (or "rasterizing") triangles. It contains sample C++ code and is accompanied by a demo program with full source code that uses SDL for display.

- [Simple Line Drawing](simple_line_drawing/)

  This article presents a simple line drawing algorithm. It contains sample C++ code and is accompanied by a demo program with full source code that uses SDL for display.

- [Cg Pixel Shaders in OpenGL](cg_pixel_shaders_in_opengl/)

  This article provides an introduction to writing pixel shaders with the Cg shader programming language and using them in OpenGL with the ARB_fragment_program extension. It contains sample C and Cg code and is accompanied by a simple diffuse lighting demo with full source code.

- [Stenciled Shadow Volumes in OpenGL](stenciled_shadow_volumes_in_opengl/)

  This article explains how to implement shadows in OpenGL, using the popular stenciled shadow volumes technique. Features sample C code and is accompanied by a demo written in C.

- [Dynamic Lightmaps in OpenGL](dynamic_lightmaps_in_opengl/)

  This article explains how to implement dynamic lightmaps in OpenGL with multitexturing. Features sample C code and is accompanied by a demo written in C.
