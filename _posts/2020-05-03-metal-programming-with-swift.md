title: Metal Programming with Swift
date: 2020-05-03

I've posted a new project on GitHub called [Metal-Swift](https://github.com/joshb/Metal-Swift), which demonstrates how to create a Metal application written in Swift. This is essentially the Metal-equivalent of my [CocoaOpenGL-Swift](https://github.com/joshb/CocoaOpenGL-Swift) project, which uses OpenGL for graphics rendering. It features a rotating, normal mapped cylinder that is illuminated by three moving point lights of different colors.

This application is intended to serve as a very simple example of using Metal to render 3D graphics, incorporating a few fundamental concepts like loading textures, using vertex/fragment shaders, and rendering a mesh. It's released under a BSD-style open source license, so feel free to incorporate any parts of it into your own projects.
